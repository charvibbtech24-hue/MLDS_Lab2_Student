## Course
Machine Learning / Deep Learning Lab

## Description
This lab implements a Deep Neural Network using Python and NumPy.  
The notebook covers forward propagation, backward propagation, cost
computation, parameter updates, and prediction on the given dataset.

## Files Included
- Assignment.ipynb – Main lab notebook containing implementation and outputs  
- dnn_app_utils_v3.py – Helper functions used by the notebook  

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository  
2. Ensure `Assignment.ipynb` and `dnn_app_utils_v3.py` are in the same folder  
3. Open `Assignment.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab  
4. Run all cells to reproduce the results  

## Outcome
The model is trained successfully and predictions are generated with
the obtained accuracy.
